# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the Form is always available.

For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using the keyboard navigation of the Form](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/form/keyboard-navigation).  

The Form supports the default browser behavior of the `<form>` tag:

| SHORTCUT | DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Tab` | Moves focus to the next focusable element. |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Moves focus to the previous focusable element.   |
| `Enter` | Triggers the default action of the focused element for the `Enter` key.   |
| `Space` | Triggers the default action of the focused element for the `Space` key.   |
