## Icons List

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/" target="_blank">Progress Design System</a> website provides a list of all <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/foundation/iconography/icon-list/" target="_blank">built-in icons in {{ site.product }}</a>.

Each icon box in the icon list is clickable and reveals the following details:

* CSS class aliases, if such exist. For example, `k-i-plus` is equivalent to `k-i-add`.
* Unicode representation of the font icon glyph. For example, `\e11e` corresponds to the `plus` icon.
* Ability to copy the glyph symbol of the font icon.
* Ability to copy the HTML markup (`<svg>` tag) of the SVG icon.

The icon list may contain icons which are not available in older versions of {{ site.product }} or even in the latest one. Such icons will be added in the next product version.
