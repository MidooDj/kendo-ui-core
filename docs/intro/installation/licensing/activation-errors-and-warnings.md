# License Activation Errors and Warnings

Using Kendo UI for jQuery without a license or with an invalid license causes specific license warnings and errors. This article defines what an invalid license is, explains what is causing it, and describes the related license warnings and errors.

## Invalid License

An invalid license can be caused by any of the following:

* Using an expired subscription licenseâ€”subscription licenses expire at the end of the subscription term.
* Using a perpetual license for product versions released outside the validity period of your license.
* Using an expired trial license.
* A missing license for Kendo UI for jQuery.
* Not [installing a license key]({% slug using-license-code %}#installing-or-updating-the-license-key) in your application.
* Not [updating the license key]({% slug using-license-code %}#installing-or-updating-the-license-key) after renewing your Kendo UI for jQuery license.

## License Warnings

If you use Kendo UI for jQuery in a project with an invalid license, the UI components exhibit the following invalid license attributes:

* A [watermark](#watermark) appears over a number of selected components.
* A [banner](#banner) is rendered on pages that use the Kendo UI for jQuery components.
