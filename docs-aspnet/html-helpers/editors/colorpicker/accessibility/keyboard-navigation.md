# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the ColorPicker is always available.

For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using the keyboard navigation of the ColorPicker](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/colorpicker/keyboard-navigation).  

The ColorPicker supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

| SHORTCUT | DESCRIPTION |

| `Enter` or `Alt/Opt(Mac) + Down` | Opens the popup (when the popup is closed). |
| `Tab` | Navigates to the next focusable element in the popup. |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Navigates to the previous focusable element in the popup.   |
| `Arrows` | Updates the saturation/value in the gradient rectangle.   |
| `Ctrl` + `Left/Right arrow` | Updates the hue slider.   |
| `Ctrl` + `Up/Down arrow` | Updates the opacity slider (when opacity is present).   |
| `Shift` | Hold for fine-tuning.   |
| `Enter` | For buttons, executes the currently focused button's action.   |
