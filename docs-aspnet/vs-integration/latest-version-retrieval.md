# Downloading New Versions of {{ site.product }}

The {{ site.product }} Visual Studio (VS) extensions enable you to keep your projects updated.

## Latest Version Acquirer Tool

The Latest Version Acquirer tool automatically retrieves the latest {{ site.product }} distribution which is available on the Telerik website. Once a day, upon loading a project with {{ site.product }} controls, the extensions query the Telerik website for a new version of the components. When a new version is detected, you receive a notification.

{% if site.core %}
![{{ site.product_short }} Entering account credentials](../vs-integration/images/nlva-core-version-message.png)
{% else %}
![{{ site.product_short }} Entering account credentials](../vs-integration/images/nlva-mvc-version-message.png)
{% endif %}

> If you disable the notifications, you can use the **Options** dialog to activate them again.

You can use the **Remember me** check-box to prevent entering your Telerik credentials multiple times. The credentials are saved securely in a per-user context. Other users on the machine do not have access to your stored credentials.

If your subscription has expired, you could either proceed with downloading a trial distribution or you could renew it and initiate the download again.

Clicking **Update Now** starts the Latest Version Acquirer tool, which prompts for your Telerik credentials. 

{% if site.core %}
![{{ site.product_short }} Entering account credentials](../vs-integration/images/nlva-core-credentials.png)
{% else %}
![{{ site.product_short }} Entering account credentials](../vs-integration/images/nlva-mvc-credentials.png)
{% endif %}

> The Latest Version Acquirer is not available with the trial license. Attempting to download a distribution results in an error message.

Clicking the **Log In** button will lead you to the Telerik sign in page, where you can enter your e-mail to log in or create a new account, if you don't have one already.

1. First, ender your e-mail:

![{{ site.product_short }} Entering e-mail](../vs-integration/images/nlva-login.png)

2. Next is the password:

![{{ site.product_short }} Entering password](../vs-integration/images/nlva-password.png)

3. And the account login is complete:

![{{ site.product_short }} Login complete](../vs-integration/images/nlva-redirect.png)

![{{ site.product_short }} Entering account credentials](../vs-integration/images/nlva-privacy.png)

## The Download Process

1. Go to the [release notes of the {{ site.product }} distribution](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-core-ui/release-history) to get information on the latest available versions.

1. In the dialog that appears, confirm the download.

{% if site.core %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Confirming the download of the latest version dialog](../vs-integration/images/nlva-core-latest.png)
{% else %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Confirming the download of the latest version dialog](../vs-integration/images/nlva-mvc-latest.png)
{% endif %}

    As a result, the latest version automatically starts to download.

{% if site.core %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Latest version download progress](../vs-integration/images/nlva-core-progress.png)
{% else %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Latest version download progress](../vs-integration/images/nlva-mvc-progress.png)
{% endif %}

1. Click **OK** when the download process of the latest version completes.

{% if site.core %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Latest version download complete](../vs-integration/images/nlva-core-complete.png)
{% else %}
    ![{{ site.product_short }} Latest version download complete](../vs-integration/images/nlva-mvc-complete.png)
{% endif %}


1. To access the latest version of {{ site.product }} after the download completes, go to **New Project Wizard**.

    > * The **Download** buttons of the **New Project Wizard** launch the **Latest Version Acquirer** tool.
    > * The **Latest Version Acquirer** tool downloads the `.zip` files which contain the latest Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core binaries and any resources that are vital for a Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core application. These get unpacked in the `%APPDATA%\Telerik\Updates` folder by default. If you find the list of the offered packages too long and you do not need the older versions, close the VS and use the Windows Explorer to delete these distributions.
